### Basic Python
1. Python Syntax.
   Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
   ```console
   >>> print("Hello, Everyone!")
   Hello, Everyone!
   ```
   Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
   ```console
   >> python myfile.py
   ```
2. Python Comments.
   Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them. For example make a simple python file (test.py) and type this example!
   ```console
   #This is a comment
   print("Hello, Everyone!")
   print("Hello, You!") #This is a comment
   ```
   Execute this script!
   ```console
   >> python test.py
   Hello, Everyone!
   Hello, You!"
   ```
3. Python Variables.
   Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
   ```console
   x = 7
   y = "Paijo"
   print(x)
   print(y)
   ```
   Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
   ```console
   x = 2        # x is of type integer
   x = "Painem" # x is now of type string
   print(x)
   ```
   If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
   ```console
   x = str(7)    # x will be '7'
   y = int(7)    # y will be 7
   z = float(7)  # z will be 7.0
   ```
4. Python Data Types
   In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
   ```console
   Text Type:	      str
   Numeric Types:	   int, float, complex
   Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
   Mapping Type:	   dict
   Set Types:	      set, frozenset
   Boolean Type:	   bool
   Binary Types:	   bytes, bytearray, memoryview
   None Type:	      NoneType
   ```
